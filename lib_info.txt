The library currently is organized as follows.

src/                    Main directory for the library.
  | basic.lean          Contains basic facts on natural numbers, lists, sets, boolean operations, etc.
  | cardinality/        Cardinality constraints and encodings.
  | cnf/                Definitions and theorems on basic CNF objects and operations.
  | demos/              Demos. Currently contains only the Sudoku example.
  | parity/             Parity constraints and encodings.

cardinality/
  | alk.lean            Defines the at-least-k constraint, alk. Proves the at-least-one encoding correct.
  | amk.lean            Defines the at-most-k constraint, amk.
  | direct_amo.lean     Defines the direct at-most-one encoding and proves it correct and well-behaved.
  | distinct.lean       A helpful notion for the at-most-one constraint that refers to two distinct positions in a list.
  | sinz_amk.lean       Defines the Sinz at-most-k constraint and proves it correct and well-behaved.
  | sinz_amo.lean       Defines the Sinz at-most-one constraint, recursively and non-, and proves it correct and well-behaved.

cnf/
  | assignment.lean     Defines the assignment type, the agree_on judgment, and aite to combine two assignments.
  | clause.lean         Defines the clause type, and various operations (including vars and evaluation under assignments).
  | cnf.lean            Defines the CNF formula type, and various operations. Depend heavily on clause.lean.
  | encoding.lean       Defines the constraint type, the encoding (function) type, correctness, and well-behavedness.

  | gensym.lean         Defines the gensym object that generates fresh variables. Used in encodings.
  | literal.lean        Defines the literal type and its evaluation under truth assignments.

demos/
  | sudoku.lean         The Sudoku constraint and encoding. Comprised of amo sub-encodings.

parity/
  | parity.lean              Defines the parity constraint and establishes its semantics.
  | direct_parity.lean       Defines the direct encoding for the parity constraint and proves it correct and well-behaved. 
                               Uses explode.lean.
  | explode.lean             A supporting file that defines the explode function, which enumerates all 
                              2^n clauses over negations on a list of literals.
  | parity.lean              Defines the parity constraint and establishes its semantics.
  | recursive_parity.lean    Defines the recursive parity encoding and proves it correct and well-behaved. The linear
                               and pooled encodings are provided as special cases of the more general encoding.
